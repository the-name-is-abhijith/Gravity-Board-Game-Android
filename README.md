# Gravity-Board-Game-Android
## A simple board game created for android using xml and kotlin.
Gravity is a simple board game similar to tic tac toe. Gravity can only be played by 2 players. Gravity board has 7 rows and 7 columns (49 cells). However, players can only start with the last row. This is because the colours inserted by each players (either RED or BLUE) cannot stay in any cell with a blank cell below it due to "GRAVITY". The player who manage to paint 4 consecutive cells with their paint vertically, horizontally or diagonally is the winner.

Note: RED is allotted to player1 (Room host) and BLUE is allotted to player2 (Room guest) only.
